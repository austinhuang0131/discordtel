# VIP Number

DTel's VIP plan works with so called 'VIP Months'. By using `>upgrade` you can transfer the VIP Months from your account to a number.

Please note: benefits and price are subject to changes. These will be announced in our [server][guildInvite].

## Current rate
£2.50 (GBP), €2.50 (EUR), $3 (USD) or CA$4 (CAD) = 1 VIP month.

If you wish to pay recursively (credit / PayPal / SEPA), use our Liberapay: <script src="https://liberapay.com/DTel/widgets/button.js"></script>
<noscript><a href="https://liberapay.com/DTel/donate"><img alt="Donate using Liberapay" src="https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg"></a></noscript>

Otherwise, you can manually donate to one of the three maintainers:

* Mitchell: [https://www.paypal.me/mdrademaker](https://www.paypal.me/mdrademaker) (PayPal `mdrademaker19@gmail.com`) - EUR preferred
* Rhys (Sun): PayPal `rhys0710@live.com` - GBP preferred
* Austin (Bus): [https://austinhuang.me/donate](https://austinhuang.me/donate) (PayPal / Interac e-Transfer `austinhuang0131@gmail.com`) - CAD preferred

Please include your username + discriminator in the comment field. If you do not, a copy of your email receipt is required for redemption. Note:

* Must be purchased in increments of whole months.
* PayPal fees, if applicable, are deducted from the donation.
* Other payment methods (Robux, gift cards, etc.) other than card/PayPal are accepted on a case-by-case basis. Please `>call *611`.


## Benefits

*	**Disable number recognition**<br/>
	With a VIP number you have the ability to disable number recognition.
	This means that the other side will be unable to see your number and usernames.
	Most details (*not all*) will also be hidden from our public logs.<br/><br/>
*	**Custom name**<br/>
	You may set a custom name for your number.
	This name will show up besides your number (instead of it with number recognition disabled) when calling.<br/><br/>
*	**VIP Emote**<br/>
	Your messages will display the VIP emote, instead of the default one.<br/><br/>
*	**Changing your number**<br/>
	Requesting a number change (by dialing `*611`) won't get rid of all your messages, contacts, phonebook settings, VIP settings, etc.<br/><br/>
*	**Number expiry**<br/>
	If your number is set to expire before the end of your VIP month(s), it will be extended to the same date as your VIP expires.<br/><br/>
*	**Reduced >pay fee**<br/>
	When sending someone credits with `>pay`, there will only be a 5% fee as opposed to 15% for non-VIP users.


## Options
You can find your newly enabled VIP options in the `*411` menu.<br/>
_Note that only someone with the Manage Server permission can access these options._
